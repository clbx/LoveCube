## LoveCube

A Wifi Enabled Message Box based on the ESP32

-----

LoveCube is an Open Source software and hardware version of the [LoveBox](https://en.lovebox.love).

All wirinng diagrams, code, and 3D models are available in this repository. The Love Box is $100, which I thought was way too much for a chip and a box. The love cube can be made for signifigantly less, has the potential to have a lot more functionality, and doesn't have the ugly ass heart on the front of it to notify a new message (this has been replaced with slick underglow LEDs).
